# Code base contributions

Contributions of code (either fixing bugs or adding new functionalities) are more than welcome.
However, please consider these basic rules and guidelines about submitting new changes.
If you follow these, you’ll help make our common efforts to make this whole thing work
a bit more easier.

## Don’t include irrelevant changes

In particular, don’t include formatting, coding style or whitespace changes to
bits of code that would otherwise not be touched by the patch. (It’s OK to fix
coding style issues in the immediate area (few lines) of the lines you’re changing.)
If you think a section of code really does need a reindent or other
large-scale style fix, submit this as a separate patch which makes no semantic
changes; don’t put it in the same patch as your bug fix/ new feature implementation.

## Split up long commits

Split up longer commits into a patch series of logical code changes.
Each change should compile and execute successfully. For instance, don’t add a
file to the makefile in patch one and then add the file itself in patch two.
(This rule is here so that people can later use tools like git bisect without
hitting points in the commit history where the build doesn’t work for reasons
unrelated to the bug they’re chasing.) Put documentation first, not last, so that
someone reading the series can do a clean-room evaluation of the documentation,
then validate that the code matched the documentation. A commit message that mentions
“Also, …” is often a good candidate for splitting into multiple commits.
For more thoughts on properly splitting commits and writing good commit messages,
see [this advice from OpenStack](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/GitCommitMessages).

## Write a meaningful commit message

Commit messages should be meaningful and should stand on their own as a
historical record of why the changes you applied were necessary or useful.

We follow some basic rules which will be examined by the example showed below.
The following is a snippet from the xdp_iface repository.

```
* 9e475b3 - bindings: python: Add example application (6 hours ago) <Iliya Iliev>
* d779316 - bindings: python: Implement recv data path (6 hours ago) <Iliya Iliev>
```

The first part of the commit (delimited by the ':' symbol) associates it with the
module/system that it is related to. Having a well organised git log and a modular
based source code is helpfull to back track bugs easily since it provides clues
for the relevant changes that are related to an issue.

## Test your changes

Although there is a continuous integration service that attempts to test newly added commits,
it still saves everyone time if you have already tested that the software contributed compiles and works.

## Reviews

Peer review only works if everyone chips in a bit of review time.
A good goal is to try to review at least as many patches from others as what you submit.
Don’t worry if you don’t know the code base. It’s perfectly fine to admit when
your review is weak because you are unfamiliar with the code.
